# **P**haserJS Arcade Controls 

This is my attempt to make the perfect game mechanics. Essentially a combination of learnings from [Game Mechanic Explorer](https://gamemechanicexplorer.com/#platformer-1) and [this](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/06/16/the-basics-behind-wall-jump-in-platform-games-html5-prototype-made-with-phaser-and-arcade-physics/) wonderful "wall jump" method by Emanuele Feronato. With some tweaks by myself.

### Live Demo

Controls: Arrow keys to move and space for jump.
